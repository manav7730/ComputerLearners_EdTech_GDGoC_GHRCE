📚 SmartPath – AI-assisted Learning Path Advisor (EdTech)
🚀 Project Idea
SmartPath is an EdTech decision-support tool that helps learners choose the right learning path based on their goals, experience level, and priorities.

Instead of giving a single recommendation, SmartPath compares multiple learning options, explains trade-offs, and helps users make informed decisions — acting as a “referee” rather than a dictator.

🎯 Problem Statement
Many learners struggle with:

Choosing the right course or learning path

Overwheling options (YouTube, bootcamps, degrees, certifications)

No clear explanation of pros vs cons

Most platforms tell users what to choose, but do not explain why.

💡 Solution
SmartPath:

Collects user preferences (goal, experience level, priority)

Compares multiple learning approaches

Shows pros, cons, and trade-offs

Provides a final insight, not a forced answer

This helps learners understand choices, not blindly follow recommendations.

🧠 Where AI is Used
Decision logic mimics AI reasoning by:

Evaluating multiple options

Applying conditional logic based on user input

Generating contextual explanations

Designed to be extendable to LLMs (Gemini / Vertex AI) in future
