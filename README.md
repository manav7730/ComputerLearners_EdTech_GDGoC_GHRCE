📚 SmartPath – AI-assisted Learning Path Advisor (EdTech)
🚀 Project Idea
SmartPath is an EdTech decision-support tool that helps learners choose the right learning path based on their goals, experience level, and priorities.

Instead of giving a single recommendation, SmartPath compares multiple learning options, explains trade-offs, and helps users make informed decisions — acting as a “referee” rather than a dictator.

🎯 Problem Statement
Many learners struggle with:

◉ Choosing the right course or learning path

◉ Overwheling options (YouTube, bootcamps, degrees, certifications)

◉ No clear explanation of pros vs cons

◉ Most platforms tell users what to choose, but do not explain why.

💡 Solution
SmartPath:

◉ Collects user preferences (goal, experience level, priority)

◉ Compares multiple learning approaches

◉ Shows pros, cons, and trade-offs

◉ Provides a final insight, not a forced answer

◉ This helps learners understand choices, not blindly follow recommendations.

🧠 Where AI is Used
Decision logic mimics AI reasoning by:

◉ Evaluating multiple options

◉ Applying conditional logic based on user input

◉ Generating contextual explanations

◉ Designed to be extendable to LLMs (Gemini / Vertex AI) in future

🛠 Tech Stack
Python

◉ Streamlit (Frontend & MVP UI)

◉ Decision Logic Module

◉ GitHub (Version control)
